# MERN_JOB_APP

A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application for creating, tracking, and managing job postings and job applications. Built with modern JavaScript, JWT-based authentication, and a RESTful API. This repository contains the server (API) and the client (React) applications.

## Demo

Include links/screenshots/gifs here when available.

## Features

- User authentication (Register / Login) with JWT
- Role-based or user-scoped operations (each user manages their own job postings)
- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) jobs
- Search, filter, and sort job listings
- Persisted data using MongoDB
- Responsive React UI for managing jobs
- Environment-configured (easy to swap dev/prod databases and secrets)

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, React Router, Axios, Context or Redux (depending on project)
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Auth: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Tooling: npm / yarn, dotenv, concurrent run (for dev), build scripts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 16 recommended) and npm or yarn
- MongoDB URI (Atlas or local)
- Git

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhatripatel06/MERN_JOB_APP.git
cd MERN_JOB_APP
```

### Install

Install dependencies for server and client.

If repo has `server` and `client` subfolders:

```bash
# from repo root
# install server deps
cd server
npm install

# install client deps
cd ../client
npm install

# return to repo root
cd ..
```

If the project is a single-package repo, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` files for server and client (if client needs env vars).

Example: server/.env

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/mern_job_app?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JWT_LIFETIME=1d
NODE_ENV=development
```

Example: client/.env (React environment variables must start with REACT_APP_)

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Adjust values for production environments.

### Run (Development)

If server and client are separate, run both concurrently:

Option A: run in two terminals

```bash
# Terminal 1 - server
cd server
npm run dev    # or `nodemon server.js` / `npm start`

# Terminal 2 - client
cd client
npm start
```

Option B: If there's a top-level script using concurrently

```bash
# from repo root
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 for client (React) and API on http://localhost:5000 (or custom PORT).

### Build & Run (Production)

Build client and serve with server (typical pattern):

```bash
# build client
cd client
npm run build

# copy or serve build from server - then start server
cd ../server
npm start
```

Adjust configuration depending on repository structure.

## Project Structure (example)

The actual structure may vary; adjust to match this repository.

- /client - React app
  - /src
    - /components
    - /pages
    - /context or /store
    - App.js, index.js
- /server - Express API
  - /controllers
  - /models
  - /routes
  - /middleware
  - server.js or app.js
- .env
- README.md

## API / Endpoints (Overview)

Example endpoints (prefix: /api or /api/v1):

- Auth
  - POST /api/auth/register — create new user
  - POST /api/auth/login — login user, returns JWT
- Jobs
  - POST /api/jobs — create job (authenticated)
  - GET /api/jobs — list jobs (with filters, pagination)
  - GET /api/jobs/:id — get job by id
  - PATCH /api/jobs/:id — update job (owner-only)
  - DELETE /api/jobs/:id — delete job (owner-only)
- Users
  - GET /api/users/me — get current user (authenticated)
  - PATCH /api/users/update — update user profile

Protect routes using auth middleware that verifies the JWT and attaches user data to the request.

## Scripts

Example npm scripts you may find or add:

- server/package.json:
  - "start": "node server.js"
  - "dev": "nodemon server.js"
- client/package.json:
  - "start": "react-scripts start"
  - "build": "react-scripts build"
  - "test": "react-scripts test"
- root/package.json (optional):
  - "dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev --prefix server\" \"npm run start --prefix client\""

Adjust scripts to match project.

## Testing

If tests exist, run:

```bash
# example
npm test
```

Add unit/integration tests for server and React components as needed.

## Deployment

Typical options:

- Deploy server to Heroku / Render / DigitalOcean / AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Host frontend on Vercel / Netlify / GitHub Pages (or serve static build from server)
- Use environment variables provided by the hosting provider (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, NODE_ENV)

CI/CD: add GitHub Actions for linting, tests, and deploy steps.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add a smaller README (short & sweet) or a more detailed one with visuals and API examples.
- Create a CONTRIBUTING.md, .env.example, or generate basic server/client templates if files are missing.
